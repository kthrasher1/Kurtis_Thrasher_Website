            <p>
                During this internship, I worked with e-commerce platforms (predominantly Shopify Plus). Typically, I
                was
                tasked with fixing bugs, creating new and additional templates for clients such as Barry M and Rio
                Health,
                as well as creating interactivity using JavaScript (ES6) and Liquid markup language.

                This role saw me volunteer to help increase the number of women in technological roles by teaching them
                new skills. This course helped women break into digital industries, teaching them how to code with a
                multitude of languages, including designing and coding a website from scratch.
